# python-api-challenge-2
Module 6 Challenge 

Hello and thank you for viewing my second attempt at this challenge. 

I encountered an error when trying to view my code through Github. Please read the information below for the solution.

Trouble-shooting Solution:
If my code from Jupyter Notebook is not rendering on GitHub then please view my code via NBViewer. Copy and past my repository (https://github.com/wsabrinabriggs/python-api-challenge-2/tree/main/starter_code) into NBViewer (https://nbviewer.org/).

FYI about NBviewer
"A free tool maintained by the Jupyter project, NBviewer is an online service that renders static Jupyter Notebooks from URLs. If you supply NBviewer with a URL that points to a GitHub repository, you can navigate the repository structure from NBviewer and select notebooks to view."
