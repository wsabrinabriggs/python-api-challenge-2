# python-api-challenge-2
Module 6 Challenge 

Hello and thank you for viewing my second attempt at this challenge. 

I had encountered an error when trying to view my code through Github. If there is a problem when reading my code, please read the information below for the solution.

Trouble-shooting Solution:
If my code from Jupyter Notebook is not rendering on GitHub then please view my code via NBViewer. Copy and past my repository (https://github.com/wsabrinabriggs/python-api-challenge-2) into NBViewer (https://nbviewer.org/).

FYI about NBviewer
"A free tool maintained by the Jupyter project, NBviewer is an online service that renders static Jupyter Notebooks from URLs. If you supply NBviewer with a URL that points to a GitHub repository, you can navigate the repository structure from NBviewer and select notebooks to view."

In step 4 of VacationPy, I increased the radius from 10,000 meters to 50,000 meters so that I would get more hotel names returned. I'm not sure why the api calls for nearest hotels returned so many "No hotels found". I worked with at tutor and we weren't able to understand why that is happening.
